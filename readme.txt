== Changelog ==

= 2.1 = 
* People are still having issues with the new version and we aren't able to replicate to fix them. I'm reverting back to the original code in 1.0. Sorry for all the updates.

= 2.0.1 =
* Some people have reported issues with the shortcode no longer working. This (hopefully) fixes it.

= 2.0 =
* Completely rebuilt by Dean Hall using pseudo-shortcodes. Content is actually stored as html, so if you disable the plugin the div's still work.


= 1.0 =
* Release of plugin
